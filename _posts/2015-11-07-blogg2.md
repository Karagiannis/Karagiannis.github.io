The question to discuss in this blog post is what do I think of static site generators and for what projects are
they suitable for.

This will be a short blogpost, because the topic is fairly clear cut. The threshold to set-up a blog is very high, it is not even
comparable with respect to  Wordpress or Joomla. The slogan  "blog like a hacker" is not for nothing. If you want have something that simply 
separates your older posts to a different page other than the index.html, you have to do some Ruby using the Liquid template.
If you like to try and test, it might give you some satisfaction, but I am of a completely different kind of breed, I usually refuse to do
anything if I am not presented or can lay my hand on the complete derivation till the last detail.
The documentation at the Jekyll project page https://jekyllrb.com/ is not complete, and one is referenced to the Jekyll forum
where knowledge is passed down from people who master Ruby, for me that is not enough. I am never interested
in having something actually working at first hand, and have the understanding coming much later after aconsiderable amount of trial and error.

It seems like a potent tool for any project, that is if you have the knowledge so that you can read and understand what is written,
and write your own code,the gear-ratio seems to be very high, on the other hand if you don't understand Ruby and the Liquid syntax,
your going to be reduced to a begging script kiddie a considerable anount of time

I don't yet have the knowledge to estimate if Jekyll would be a suitible choice for a site like amazon.com, but it seems to me that if it can host
github and their database which must be rather big, it must be able to handle a site as amazon .com
considering the fact that the github site is run on Jekyll
As i've understtod it, the amount of transactions a site can handle is a matter of how many SQL-servers you can have running in tandem,
and that is only limited to the amount of hardware one can afford. 

If you can build the fairly complex Github interface on it, and handle its database and do it so fast because of its static nature, what 
is the limit? I don't see any limits.

Depending on the level of competence of the developer, it can be used for anything. I don't know Ruby, so I cannot estimate
how much lines of codes it would take to set up a Github site or an e-commerce site, but the code snippets that I've seen have been short
and compact and deliver content with few lines of code, the edownside must be that the level of competence must be scaled inversily proprtional to the
the compactness of the code.
